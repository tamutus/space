        <em>
          This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which I collect, use,
          maintain, and disclose information collected from users (each, a
          "User") of my website (the "Site") and any related services offered by
          me. This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and
          services offered by me.
        </em>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>
          I may collect personal identification information from Users in a
          variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit my
          site, register on the site, place an order, fill out a form, respond
          to a survey, and in connection with other activities, services,
          features, or resources I make available on my Site. Users may be asked
          for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone
          number, and credit card information. I will collect personal
          identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit
          such information to me. Users can always refuse to supply personal
          identification information, though that may prevent them from engaging
          in certain Site-related activities.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-personal identification information</h2>

        <p>
          I may collect non-personal identification information about Users
          whenever they interact with my Site. Non-personal identification
          information may include the browser name, the type of computer, and
          technical information about Users' means of connection to my Site,
          such as the operating system and the Internet service providers
          utilized and other similar information.
        </p>

        <h2>Web browser cookies</h2>

        <p>
          My Site may use "cookies" to enhance the User experience. Users' web
          browsers place cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes
          and sometimes to track information about them. Users may choose to set
          their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert them when cookies are
          being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not
          function properly.
        </p>

        <h2>How I use collected information</h2>

        <p>
          I collect and use Users' personal information for the following
          purposes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>To improve customer service</li>
          <li>To personalize user experience</li>
          <li>To process payments</li>
          <li>To send periodic emails</li>
          <li>To respond to inquiries and customer support requests</li>
          <li>To run promotions, contests, surveys, or other Site features</li>
          <li>To comply with applicable laws and regulations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How I protect your information</h2>
        <p>
          I adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices
          and security measures to protect against unauthorized access,
          alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information,
          username, password, transaction information, and data stored on my
          Site. I continually research how to improve the security of my web
          infrastructure. I review and assess known security flaws in libraries
          I may use before integrating them. Up-to-date security measures are of
          paramount importance to me, and I act promptly to address any security
          incidents or known exploits.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing your personal information</h2>

        <p>
          I do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification
          information to others. I may share generic aggregated demographic
          information not linked to any personal identification information
          regarding visitors and users with my business partners, trusted
          affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-party websites</h2>

        <p>
          Users may find advertising or other content on my Site that links to
          the sites and services of my partners, suppliers, advertisers,
          sponsors, licensors, and other third parties. I do not control the
          content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible
          for the practices employed by websites linked to or from my Site. In
          addition, these sites or services, including their content and links,
          may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their
          own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and
          interaction on any other website, including websites that have a link
          to my Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>

        <p>
          I have the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When
          I do, I will post a notification on the main page of my Site and
          revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. I encourage Users
          to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about
          how I are helping to protect the personal information I collect. You
          acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review
