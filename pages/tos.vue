        <p>
          I reserve the right to terminate or restrict your use of the Service,
          without notice or liability, for any reason or no reason, including if
          I believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the
          letter or spirit of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>
          The Service and its entire contents, features, and functionality
          (including but not limited to all information, software, text,
          displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and
          arrangement thereof) are owned by me or my licensors and are protected
          by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade
          secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may copy, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display,
          publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit any of the
          material on my Service that are explicitly made accessible to the
          general public, unless you plan to do so:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>

            innocent people
          </li>
          <li>to endorse discrimination, capitalism, violence, or abuse</li>
          <li>to support harming the environment or animals</li>

        <p>
          If I provide social media features with certain content, you may take
          such actions as are enabled by such features.
        </p>

        <h3>Adult Content</h3>

        <p>
          The Service may contain adult content, and I take appropriate measures
          to ensure such content is restricted to consenting adults, such as
          manually approving requests to view adult content with age
          confirmation.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you request access to any adult-restricted content on the Service,
          you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age, and
          you acknowledge and agree that the content on adult sections of the
          website are intended for adults only. You agree not to share any adult
          content provided by our service with minors under any circumstance. If
          your authorization credentials grant you access to adult content, you
          agree not to share your login credentials to a minor. We reserve the
          right to refuse access to anyone who shares our adult content with
          minors, the general public, or public or private groups where minors
          are present. Any breach of this provision may result in immediate
          termination of your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may not share such adult content, or access to such adult content,
          for any purpose with individuals who are minors in either their
          relevant jurisdiction or yours, . If you do, you thereby relinquish
          your right to use my Service in entirety, and I may not be held liable
          for choosing to inform relevant authorities about suspected grooming
          or
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

        <p>
          The Service is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind. I
          make no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied,
          regarding the Service or its contents, including but not limited to
          any warranty of accuracy, completeness, currency, reliability, or
          non-infringement. I disclaim all liability and responsibility arising
          from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor
          to the Service, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its
          contents.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p>
          In no event shall I or my affiliates be liable to you or any third
          party for any damages whatsoever, including but not limited to direct,
          indirect, special, consequential, or punitive damages, arising out of
          or relating to the use or inability to use the Service or any
          materials or information available on the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles
          of conflicts of law.
        </p>
